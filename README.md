# Fun Race Clone

A clone of the android/iOS game Fun Race 3D

- The time it took for the exercise was 5 hours
- The most dificult part was trying to replicate the camera movement of the original game
- I could do level design a lot better, or actually do a level, right now it's just a placeholder/test level I was focused
mainly in coding
- I think that by adding one skill/ability to a player that allows him to sabotage other player will add to 
competitiveness of the game, also giving a pool of various abilities from where the player can choose and buy can help with
retention and revenue.
- Final thoughts, this 5 hour project is a good prototype at least to show and pitch the game's idea.

Clicking/Touching the screen will make the player move along the path
